Introduction to SQL - lets get mentally prepared
Learning Goals
    Understand why we need databases
    Know what a Relational database management system is 
    be able to access data in a database and perform basic operations

How do websites store data?
    Databases!

    there are different models of databses 
        they differ in how they store data and how that data can therefore be accessed
    were going to use a relational database model. Relational refers to the use of tables to store
    and organize data   
        each table is referred to as a relation, as it is a collection of related data entries

    Two parts to storing and accessing data:
        1 DataBase management system
            an application that stores data at scale and can be queried for data
        2 The Querying Language
            The language we use to interact with the database management system to create our database, insert data,
            and query it for data

    RDBMS - Relational Database management system
        An application that stores data at scale and organizes the data in tables

        we will be using
            postgreSQL 
                well be using this for the next two days and for most projects
            SQLite
                thursdays projects

Relational Data:

SQL: The way we communicate with our database
    Structured Query Language
    DSL - Domain Specific Language

What can SQL do?
    can create new databases
    create new tables in a database
    insert records in a database
    update records in a database
    delete records in a database
    can retrieve data from a database

Column Types
    Every column must have a declared data type, some common ones:
    varchar
    boolean
    integer
    float
    date
    many, many more
    see postgreSQL.org docs for more information on data data Types

    postgresql shell commands
        psql
        CREATE DATABASE lecture;
        psql lecture
        \d - list tables
        \d table - show schema for table
        \? to list meta commands
        end queries with a ;
