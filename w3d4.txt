What is Git
    Git is a VCS, Version Control System
    Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for the Linux Kernal

Why Git - Industry Standard
    Versioning
    Collaboration

How Does Git Work
    Repository: Stores a set of files or directories in VCS
    files are saved in a commit
    Does not store entire project in each commit
    Each commit is a snapshot of what chaged since the last commit
    cloning or downloading a repo grabs the entire commit history

Gits Internal System
    working directory
        all files and folders on your local machine
    Staging Area
        tracks specified chages to working directory
    Commit history
        snapshots of project stored in .Git

Local Repositories
    local = On the machine
    remote = online code hosting service like GitHub

Local Repo Commands
    git init
        creates local git repo
    git status
        see current changes from last commit
    git log 
        see list of commits

Local Repo Vocab
    untracked
        any newly introduced file (not in previous snapshot)
    unstaged
        file that exists in .git but has been chaged since last commit
    staged
        files added to staging area, awaiting commit
    committed
        files that have beeen committed to .git

Local Repo Commands 2
    git add <file-name>
        add a single file to staging
    git add .
        add all files from curren directory
    git add -A
        add all files in entire working tree
    git commit -m <message>
        moves updates from staging area to .git
        start with a verb;imperative mood; no emoji; no ending
        punctuation
    git diff
        show what changed from last commit to staged changes
       
    Git will not acknowledge directories without files inside

Git Reset
    powerful command used to undo local chages to the state of a Git repo

Local Reset Commands
    git reset file-name
        remove a file from staging area
        doesnt affect working directory
    git reset   
        unstage everything
        doesnt affect working directory
    git reset --hard
        reset staging area and working directory to match the
        most recent commit
        affects working directory

Remote Repositories
    What is GitHub  
        webservice that integrates git 
        Great for multiple developers to work in teams

Remote Commands
    origin
        keyword referring to default remote reop (default repo name)
    git remote  
        command to list remotes
    git remote add <remote> <remote-url>
        adds a remote
    git push <remote> <branch name>
        moves updates from .git to remote repository
    git push -u <remote> <branch name>
        moves updates from .git to remote repository, sets upstream branch
