Recuresion Lecture
    - Learning Objectives
        have a process for approaching recursive problems
        understand what the inductive step is and how to build inductive
        know the advantages of memoization

    - Lecture Outline
        recursion for today
        how to think about recursion
        movie theater example
        demos, a lot
        recursion reasoning tips
        kahoot!

    -What we're not doing
        use loops* - not using loops to Recurse, but can use loops and recursion together
        modify method argument
        use an optional private argument
        think linear or procedural terms
        be mentally refreshed at the end of the day
        Head scratcher day. 

    -What we are doing today    
        write methods that call themselves
        break problems down incrementally
        trust that your method already works for all previous cases
        learn a new way of thinking and programming

    -What is a recursive function?
        A  function that calls itself
        solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems
        has a base case - simplest "already solved" condition
        builds back up incrementally using and inductive step
        We can have n base cases***********

    -Inductive step
        How we use the return value of the previous stem to determine
        the current result. 

    -Problem Solving process
        Understand the Problem****
        Identify the Base case****
        Write one step up from base case
        Logic for inductie step
        Code it Out
    
    -Code Demos

    -memoization
        is an optimization technique used to speed up methods
        by storing the results of a costly function call and 
        retruning the cached result when the same input occurs
        again.

        i.e. saving function calls to a variable

    -Final thoughts
        The Recursion process
            simplify the problem


    -tips
        Assume your last call should return and build inductive step
        from theater
        Use small examples to visualize things

        look at how you can reduce the input on each call
        return same data type.
