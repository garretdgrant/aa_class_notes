Object Oriented Programming
    OOP can feel like an overwhelming topic
    lets talk 

OOP Context
    What is a programmer's greatest enemy?

OOP Goal: Control Complexity
    Countless ways to solve a problem
    OOp gives a structured way to break down that Complexity
        its relatively easy for humans to grasp

Complexity Limits Solutions
    code complexity limit = short-term memory limit
    We can hold 4 things in short-term memory
        if we reduce the mental complexity of code, we increase the
        the complexity of the problems we can solve. 
    
    places related code in the same places
    limits inter-dependencies in code
    Helps keep code DRY
    Intuitive because it mirrors phusical reality

What is OOP
    Procedural: Opposite of OOP
        functions operating on data
        emphasis: step by step instructions
    Object-Oriented:
        functions and data are combined into objects
        emphasis: interactions between objects.

    Objects Contain data
    objects have methods
    methods can access and modify an object's state (any data that it contains)
    objects can interact with one another via their methods

Classes vs Objects
    A class is a blueprint for creating objects
    An object is an instance of a class
    In Ruby, onjects are instantiated using ::new, which calls #initialize
