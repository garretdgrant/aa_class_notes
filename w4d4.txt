    Why do we test?
    What is TDD?
    What is the testing pyramid?
    Be familiar with Rspec library

Why do we test?
    Working with a lot of people, dont want to break others code
    Testing can help isolate problems, Example: We add a feature and break the program
    Specs can show us the purpose of the program we are creating

TDD Workflow:
    Write Failing Test
    Write just enought code to pass test
    Improve the Code Quality (Refactor)
    Repeat

What do we Test? The testing pyramid
    Test Pyramid:
      1-5% Top: E2E(end-to-end) Tests Does the whole thing work
      10-15% Mid:  Integration Tests 
      80-90% Base:  Unit Test - Singular feature or class (Isoloation Tests)

How do we test?
    We cannot test protected, private, we can only test the API.
    We test these methods by testing the public methods using the private methods
    Goal is to test the public facing API

Rspec
    Domain-Specific Language (DSL) wtritten in Ruby for Ruby
    Meta-gem that includes rspec-core, rspec-expectations and rspec mocks
    Not the only Ruby testing library, others include minitest and cucumber.
